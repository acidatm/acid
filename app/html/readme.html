  <h1>ACID</h1>
  <h2>Documentation</h2>
  <p>All values in the GUI range between 0 and 999, where 0 is the minimum value and 999 is the maximum. The GUI can be toggled either with the space bar or using the options in <em>Menubar &gt; Window</em>. The GUI can also be opened in a second window.</p>
  <p>The labels next to the sliders can be used to set a slider to specific value. The buttons next to the labels can be used to minimize, center, maximize or randomize the slider value. Both can be disabled from the <em>set</em> part of the GUI.</p>
  <h3>Oscilators</h3>
  <p>An oscilator is either a cyclic transfer function or a noise based algorithm. A cyclic transfer function takes a value between 0 and infinity and returns a value between 0 and 1, the exact distribution of the values inbetween is determined by the oscilators waveform. The amount of values after which the oscilator repeats is determined by its frequency.</p>
  <p>You can use oscilators as fixed filters by setting the <em>spd</em> parameter to 0. This will stop the oscilator from moving entirely. You can then control the exact character of the filter with the <em>frq</em>, <em>off</em> and <em>rot</em> parameters.</p>
  <p>If you need a constant fixed value from an oscilator, you can use a <em>sqr</em> oscilator, with a <em>spd</em> of 0 and a low <em>frq</em>. You can then control the exact value using the <em>min</em> or <em>max</em> parameter.</p>
  <p>If you need a completely random texture, create an oscilator with a medium value and apply a high <em>rnd</em> effect on it.</p>
  <p>All oscilators have an additional &quot;run&quot; property, which can be set to quickly mute an oscilator. You can toggle it by clicking on &quot;osx&quot; (where x is the oscilator number) in the GUI. The run property behaves identical to the <em>off</em> type, but doesnt change the type of the oscilator.</p>
  <h4>Channels</h4>
  <p>All oscilators can send to 3 different channels independently. They send the same basic value to each channel but you can attenuate the value for each channel individually. You can do so from the <em>rgb</em> section using the inputs for <em>r</em>,<em>g</em> and <em>b</em>.</p>
  <h4>Cyclical oscilators</h4>
  <p>These are the available cyclical oscilators:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>sqr</strong> (Square) - will create a squarewave, that is either high or low, but has no inbetween states</li>
  <li><strong>pwm</strong> (Pulse) - will create a pulse oscilator (and <em>Pulse Width Modulation</em> will be available in the near future)</li>
  <li><strong>saw</strong> (Sawtooth) - will create a sawtooth wave, that starts high and falls to low in a linear fashion</li>
  <li><strong>tri</strong> (Triangle) - will create a triangle wave, that switches between high and low in linear fashion</li>
  <li><strong>sin</strong> (Sine) - will create a sine wave, that switches between high and low in non linear fashion</li>
  <li><strong>osc</strong> (Oscilator) - will create a flexible oscilator, which can take any shape between a pure triangle over a pure sine to pure square. The pulse width can be modified, which can turn a triangle into a ramp or saw, or change the width of a squarewave. But it can also do any shape inbetween.</li>

  </ul>
  <p>For each oscilator these are the important parameters:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><p><strong>typ</strong> (Type) - will determine the type of oscilator to use</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><strong>min</strong> (Minimum) - sets the minimum amplitude (normally 0)</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><strong>max</strong> (Maximum) - sets the maximum amplitude (normally 999)</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><strong>lpf</strong> (Low Pass Filter) - Values above this threshold will be cut. The filter behaves relative to <em>min</em> and <em>max</em></p>
  </li>
  <li><p><strong>hpf</strong> (High Pass Filter) - Values below this treshold will be cut. The filter behaves relative to <em>min</em> and <em>max</em></p>
  </li>
  <li><p><strong>mix</strong> (Mixing) - The way this oscilator should be mixed with other oscilators</p>
  <ul>
  <li><em>ADD</em> (Additive) - Add the value to the mix</li>
  <li><em>SUB</em> (Subtractive) - Removes the value from the mix</li>
  <li><em>MLT</em> (Multiply) - Multiplies the mix with the value</li>
  <li><em>DIV</em> (Divide) - Divides the mix by the value</li>

  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><p><strong>rot</strong> (Oscilator Rotation) - Will rotate the oscilator in 2D space</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><strong>frq</strong> (Oscilator Frequency) - Determines the frequency of the oscilation</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><strong>spd</strong> (Oscilator Speed) - Determines how fast the oscilator moves through 2D space in the direction set by <em>rot</em></p>
  </li>
  <li><p><strong>off</strong> (Oscilator Offset) - Will change the phase of the oscilation, which us really only useful when <em>speed</em> is at 0</p>
  </li>

  </ul>
  <p>The <em>osc</em> oscilator has these additional parameters:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>cen</strong> (Oscilator Center) - sets the high point of the oscilation relative to the wavelength. 0 means right at the start (which would make a triangle wave a saw wave), 999 means right at the end (which would make a triangle wave a ramp wave)</li>
  <li><strong>shp</strong> (Oscilator Shape) - determines the general shape of the oscilator. It does so by fading between pure triangle wave (0), pure sine wave (499) and pure squarewave (999)</li>

  </ul>
  <h4>Noncyclical oscilators</h4>
  <p>These are the available, noncyclical oscilators:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>plx</strong> (Simplex Noise) - An advanced correlating noise algorithm</li>
  <li><strong>prl</strong> (Perlin Noise) - A less advanced correlating noise algorithm</li>
  <li><strong>org</strong> (Organic) - A noise algorithm that creates &quot;organic&quot; shapes like water ripples or woodgrain (it is simplex noise passed through a seeded random number generator)</li>
  <li><strong>off</strong> (Off) - turns the oscilator off</li>

  </ul>
  <p>The noncyclical oscilators use some of the  cyclical oscilator settings, however they are used somewhat different:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>frq</strong> (Oscilator Frequency) - Determines the frequency of the noise plane, which will feel more like its resolution or graininess maybe</li>
  <li><strong>off</strong> (Oscilator Offset) - Will move to a fixed value on the plane of the noise</li>

  </ul>
  <p>The organic oscilator also uses the two additional settings from the <em>osc</em> oscilator</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>cen</strong> (Oscilator Center) - determines how many different steps or layers are generated</li>
  <li><strong>shp</strong> (Oscilator Shape) - blends between quantised and unquantised noise</li>

  </ul>
  <p> There are also a couple of additional settings for the two noise algorithms, as they are 3 dimensional. The oscilator settings control the z axis, the other two axis are controlled by their respective parameters. All axis have the same set of parameters.</p>
  <p>The noise algorithms are seedable, which means same values in, same values out. You can reseed the noise algorithms from <em>Menubar &gt; Render &gt; Reseed</em>.</p>
  <h3>Effects</h3>
  <p>All oscilators can have any number of effects applied to them. Which effects are applied is set by the effects chain (&quot;--- + &quot; in the GUI). Clicking on &quot;+&quot; will add a new effect to the chain, clicking on an effect will flip through the different effect types, clicking on &quot;---&quot; (which will then show &quot;clr&quot;) will clear the effect chain. Effects are passed through from left to right.</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>---</strong> (List) - marks the presence of a list. Clicking will clear the list</li>
  <li><strong>+</strong> (Add) - can be clicked to add new entrys to the list.</li>

  </ul>
  <p>The settings for all effects in the chain are the same. However you can use the chain to apply effects in different order or multiple times. The settings are set in the <em>fx</em> part of the respective GUI section:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>bit</strong> (Bitreduction) - Will reduce the number of possible values down to only a single one. 0 means no reduction, 999 means maximum reduction.</li>
  <li><strong>cmp</strong> (Compression) - Will make lower values higher while influencing higher values less.</li>
  <li><strong>exp</strong> (Expansion) - Will make lower values even lower while influencing higher values less. Works somewhat in reverse to compression.</li>
  <li><strong>rnd</strong> (Randomization) - Will randomly change values. A low setting will result in a more &quot;analog&quot; look, while a high setting will make things very glitchy</li>
  <li><strong>drv</strong> (Drive) - Will amplify all values equally. Can be used as a preamp or overdrive.</li>

  </ul>
  <h3>Render</h3>
  <p>The parameters for the render process can be found under &quot;img&quot;. The render process determines how the values generated by ACID and the configuration set in the GUI are used to generate images. Not all settings are available at all times, some may only be visible when a certain color mode or render engine is active.</p>
  <ul>
  <li><p><strong>frm</strong> (Framerate) - the desired framerate for the undocked render window. To not display visible jumbs between frames the render process will render frame after frame and not skip frames. This can result in exported GIFs looking faster. You can see the true FPS in the settings tab</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><strong>res</strong> (Resolution) - resolution for the undocked render window</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><strong>pre</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>res</strong> (Preview Resolution) - resolution for the main window</li>
  <li><strong>frm</strong> (Preview Framerate) - framerate for the main window</li>

  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><p><strong>bw</strong> (Black and White) - blends between color and black and white </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><strong>brn</strong> (Burn) - can be used to lighten the image when subpixels are enabled</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><strong>drv</strong> (Drivetype) - this is the clipping stage of the master amplifier, there are 3 settings available:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>clp</strong> (Clip) - Will simply clip all values over 1 and make them 1</li>
  <li><strong>mod</strong> (Modify) - Will wrap all values over 1 until they are below 1. 1.5 would become 0.5, 2.3 would become 0.3 and so on.</li>
  <li><strong>dyn</strong> (Dynamic) - Will redistribute all values on a range between the frames lowest and highest value, making it impossible to clip the amp (however you can use a compressor or drive and a low pass filter to achieve the effect on an oscilator level)</li>

  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><p><strong>clr</strong> (Colormode) - Changes the colormode. You can click on the GUI label to activate a fixed HSL based color mode, which can be helpfull to see how the oscilators effect each other.</p>
  <ul>
  <li><em>rgb</em> (Linear RGB) - ACID can effect a linear RGB space</li>
  <li><em>grd</em> (Gradient) - ACID can effect the value on a range between any amount of  colors. The colors are determined by the values in the color list. The black and white values between 0 and 1 are used to determine the position on the gradient.</li>
  <li><em>ndx</em> (Indexed) - works just like gradient. Except its not a gradient but a stepped gradient with no mix between the steps.</li>

  </ul>
  </li>

  </ul>
  <h4>Feedback</h4>
  <p>The virtual feedback engine simulates true feedback when using a camera that is pointed on a screen that displays the camera image. Simulates, not duplicates. It is different. But based around the same idea. As ACID is deterministic we can now the value of each pixel at any point in time. And that is exactly how the feedback works. We simply don&#39;t show all pixels at the same point in time at the same time.</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>int</strong> (Feedback Intensity) - Intensity of the feedback, basically how far into the future we go at max</li>
  <li><strong>edg</strong> (Feedback Quantization) - How much the feedback is quantized. This will lead to visible jumps/edges</li>
  <li><strong>x</strong> (Feedback Center X) - relative x position of the center of the feedback</li>
  <li><strong>y</strong> (Feedback Center Y) - relative y position of the center of the feedback</li>
  <li><strong>mix</strong> (Feedback Mix) -  mixes between horizontal and vertical feedback</li>
  <li><strong>bnd</strong> (Feedback Bend) - mixes between linear and feedbacked feedback (you read that right, the feedback can feedback on it self). This will lead to more bended lines then straight lines</li>
  <li><strong>skw</strong> (Feedback Skew) - mixes between horizontal and vertical bend</li>
  <li><strong>sqr</strong> (Feedback Squaring/Linearity) - mixes between a linear and a stepped version of the feedback. Linear look like a triangle, stepped like a square (so like classic tv feedback)</li>
  <li><strong>drk</strong> (Feedback Darken) - makes the feedback darker the further back it is in time (like classic tv feedbacks)</li>

  </ul>
  <h3>Settings</h3>
  <p>The settings part of the GUI can be found under &quot;set&quot;. Here you can change default values, GUI styles and some global settings for the render engine.</p>
