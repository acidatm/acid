SCREEN
The visual output is presented on a scalable screen.
The screen is made up of pixels which can take an rgb color value.
What is visible on the screen is determined by a set of layers.

LAYERS
Layers can be mixed in different ways and will be layered on top of each other in a specific order.
A layer can have exactly one engine, that determines how virtual data is displayed visually.
There are currently these engines available:
s2D - pixelbased 2D engine
c2D - cellbased 2D engine
ASC - ASCII engine

A layers contains a set of oscilators, algorithms and sources, which make up the total image data available

0-z - values between 0 and 35, serve to input parameters values
A-Z - Variables
+ - additive summing
- - substractive summing
* - multiplying summing
/ - dividing summing
% - modulating summing

() - parameters for a function, not passing parameters sets them to 0 automatically
[] - layer array of functions

LAYERS


SOURCES
~(center,shape,frequency,speed,rotation,offset) - oscilator
$(xspeed,xgrain,yspeed,ygrain,zspeed,zgrain) - noise algorithm
!(index,relative width, relative height) - image
#(width,height,binary) - sprite

FUNCTIONS
=(min,max,lpf,hpf)
