V0.2
Rework resolution to work as expected in combination with oscilator frequencys

Optimise code speed

Add midi sync

Add presets

Add midi pcm

Add midi cc control with learnable parameters

Add sequencers and lfos

Add small controll screen in second GUI

Add feedback two simple 2d render engine

Add output filter (mandala style)

Add text render overlay as optional render engine

Rework Oscilators to become layers with selectable type, subtype and common parameters like fx and rot

Available layertypes:
osc - the standard Oscilators
alg - the standard noise algorithms and "logic" based
img - bitmap image with integer values, possible to animate
spr - tileable sprite texture, possbile to animate

Image
Load in a bitmap image that can be stretched, proportionally fitted or scaled and tiled.
The image may be animated by either:
passing an array of images that is cycled through at a specific rate
or panning across the image in a specific rate (steps/frames)

Sprites
Generate a sprite that can have up to 4bit resolution.
It can be stretched, proportionally fitted or scaled and tiled
The sprite may be animated by either:
passing an array of sprites that is cycled through at a specific rate
or panning across the sprite in a specific rate (steps/frames)
